# OpenCV Projects

Welcome, 

My name is [Dr. Frazer K. Noble](http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=803250) and I am a lecturer at Massey University's School of Engineering and Advanced Technology (SEAT), Albany, New Zealand.

This repository is a collection of projects and tutorials for getting started and working with the Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) library. I intend this to be an ongoing effort that I will update on a regular basis; I hope that it may be of some use to you.

I have used the following tools to create each project:
 1. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/).
 1. [OpenCV 3.2](http://opencv.org/).
 1. [Logitec c920 USB Camera](https://www.logitech.com/en-nz/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920).
 
Furthermore, each project has been compiled and run on a PC running Windows 8 x64 to ensure they work.

Best regards,

Frazer
